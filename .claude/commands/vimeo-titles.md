# Analyze Vimeo videos and generate viral titles for batch updating

**Process the following videos: $ARGUMENTS**

**Context: Journey to 1M Revenue/Impact Series**
**Known Projects**: ProX, FinX, BusinessX, WarriorX, Proco Pro XI

**‚ö° Workflow Steps (Token-Optimized):**

1. **List Videos with Pagination (Avoid Token Overflow)**
   ```
   mcp__vimeo__vimeo_list_videos(
     compact: true,      # CRITICAL: Prevents 42K+ token responses
     per_page: 6,        # Max safe limit per request
     page: [1,2,3...],   # Paginate through all videos
     sort: "date",       # Get chronological order
     direction: "desc"   # Most recent first
   )
   ```
   - Parse timeframe from $ARGUMENTS (e.g., "July 13 to today")
   - Filter results by date range after retrieval
   - Group videos by date for organized processing

2. **Download Transcripts to Filesystem (Avoid Token Limits)**
   ```
   mcp__vimeo__vimeo_download_transcript_to_file(
     video_id: "[video_id]",
     base_path: "/Users/sangle/Dev/action/projects/mcp-servers/@download/vimeo",
     format: "webvtt",
     language: "en"
   )
   ```
   - Downloads to: `@download/vimeo/[date]/transcripts/[date]_[title]_[id].vtt`
   - Avoids 30K+ token responses from direct transcript reading
   - Enables local file analysis with pagination

3. **Read and Analyze Transcript Content**
   ```
   Read(
     file_path: "[transcript_path]",
     head: 1000  # Read in chunks if needed for large files
   )
   ```
   - Analyze content for:
     * Project names (ProX, FinX, BusinessX, WarriorX, Proco Pro XI, or detect new ones)
     * Technical tools mentioned (Claude, AI models, frameworks, specific tech stack)
     * Session type (coding, marketing, planning, strategy, sprint sessions)
     * Time constraints (1 hour, sprint sessions, race against time)
     * Key achievements, breakthroughs, or major progress
     * Specific features or functionality being built
     * Business goals and milestones mentioned

4. **Generate 5 Viral Title Options per Video** using standardized format:
   
   **Standard Format**: `Day [#] - [1M Journey] - [Motivation/Coding/Both(MoCo)] - [Viral Hook Title]`
   
   Examples:
   - `Day 25 - 1M Journey - Coding - Building AI Agents to Automate My Vimeo Workflow`
   - `Day 24 - 1M Journey - MoCo - Backend Cleanup Sprint: From Chaos to Clean Architecture`
   - `Day 13 - 1M Journey - Motivation - Why I Ditched Cursor for Claude Code (Real Numbers Inside)`

   **Engagement patterns to use**:
   - **Time pressure hooks**: "1-Hour Sprint", "Race Against Time", "30-Minute Build"
   - **Project-specific**: Include exact project names (ProX, FinX, etc.)
   - **Value proposition**: "How I Built", "The Strategy That", "Why I Chose"
   - **Curiosity gaps**: "What Happened When", "The Secret to", "What They Don't Tell You"
   - **Specificity**: Mention exact tools, results, timeframes, dollar amounts
   - **Social proof**: Reference "Journey to 1M" series consistently
   - **Problem/Solution**: "From Stuck to Success", "The Bug That Almost Killed"
   - **Behind the scenes**: "Real Talk:", "Unfiltered:", "Raw Process:"

5. **Create Optimized Descriptions** for each video:
   ```

7. **Create Bulk Update Commands** using API token from .env:
   ```bash
   # For each video, generate curl command:
   export VIMEO_API_TOKEN=$(grep VIMEO_API_TOKEN .env | cut -d'=' -f2)
   
   curl -X PATCH "https://api.vimeo.com/videos/[VIDEO_ID]" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIMEO_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "[Selected viral title]",
       "description": "[Optimized description]",
       "privacy": {"view": "anybody"},
       "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"...]
     }'
   ```

8. **Create comprehensive summary report** with:
   ```markdown
   # üé¨ Video Title Analysis Summary - [Date Range]

   ## Videos Processed: [Number]

   ### üìπ Video [N]: [Date] (ID: [VideoID])

## üìã Complete Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: List videos (July 13-25 example)
mcp__vimeo__vimeo_list_videos(compact: true, per_page: 6, page: 1, sort: "date", direction: "desc")
# Continue with page: 2, 3, 4 until all videos retrieved

# Step 2: For each video, download transcript
mcp__vimeo__vimeo_download_transcript_to_file(
  video_id: "1104516203",
  base_path: "/Users/sangle/Dev/action/projects/mcp-servers/@download/vimeo"
)

# Step 3: Read and analyze transcript
Read(file_path: "/Users/sangle/Dev/action/projects/mcp-servers/@download/vimeo/2025-07-25/transcripts/2025-07-25_new-recording-7252025-113950-am_1104516203.vtt", head: 1000)

# Step 4: Generate viral metadata based on content
# Example output:
Title: "Day 25 - 1M Journey - Coding - Building AI Agents to Automate My Vimeo Workflow"
Description: "üöÄ Day 25 of my journey to $1M in revenue/impact..."
Tags: ["1M journey", "vimeo automation", "ai agents", "mcp servers", "claude code", ...]

# Step 5: Create bulk update script
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vimeo.com/videos/1104516203" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIMEO_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Day 25 - 1M Journey - Coding - Building AI Agents to Automate My Vimeo Workflow",
    "description": "üöÄ Day 25 of my journey to $1M in revenue/impact...",
    "tags": ["1M journey", "vimeo automation", "ai agents", "mcp servers", "claude code"]
  }'
```

**üéØ Result**: Videos optimized for viral reach with content-aware titles, engaging descriptions, and strategic tags!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Lessons Learned

### 1. **Day Number Verification**
- **CRITICAL**: Always check the beginning of transcripts for actual day numbers
- The user may skip days, so calendar dates don't always match sequential day numbers
- Example: July 13 = Day 186, July 25 = Day 191 (only 6 day numbers for 13 calendar days)
- **Action**: Download and read first few lines of transcript to find "day [number]" announcement

### 2. **Tag Encoding Issue**
- **Problem**: Vimeo API requires URL encoding for tags with special characters
- **Solution**: Fixed in `vimeo-client.ts` by adding `encodeURIComponent()` to tag paths
- **Code**: `this.makeApiCall("DELETE", \`${path}/${encodeURIComponent(tag.tag)}\`)`

### 3. **Use MCP Tools Directly**
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp__vimeo__vimeo_update_video()` directly instead of bash scripts
- **Benefits**: Better error handling, automatic retries, integrated rate limiting
- **Example**:
  ```
  mcp__vimeo__vimeo_update_video(
    video_id: "1104516203",
    title: "Day 191 - 1M Journey - Coding - Building AI Agents"
  )
  ```

### 4. **Handle Video Not Found Errors**
- Some video IDs may return "The requested video couldn't be found"
- This could be due to privacy settings or deleted videos
- Always verify video exists before attempting updates

### 5. **Description Day Number Consistency**
- **Issue**: Descriptions often contain the old day number in the first line
- **Action**: When updating titles, consider updating descriptions to match
- **Example**: If title says "Day 191", description should also say "Day 191"
